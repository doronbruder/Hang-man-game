Section C-q1:
Why did I choose these inputs :
First input-case that pattern  should updated in multiple indexes
Second input-make sure pattern doesnt changed
 when the letter isnt in the word
Third input:make sure pattern doesnt
 changed when the chosen letter already uncovered
Forth input:make sure still works when the pattern consist of single letter

Section C-q2:
‪1.The valid test of the letter input
-since I checked if its a lower case and In Hebrew
 there is no such a thing instead,
  I would need  to create  a function‬
that will check if the char is part of the Hebrew alphabet

2.Ending-letters-in update_word_pattern 
in Hebrew compare to English 
there are ending letters which means 
That every time in the code the user
 choose a letter we need to  to check  
if its in the end of the pattern  the 
pattern will uncover the ending version of the letter 

3.My "choose_letter function" based particularly 
on the abc- so I would need to replace the 
List to the Hebrew  alphabet
